# ðŸ—„ Archival Notice

**This repository is being archived in May 2021.** This repository was originally conceived as a joint project between the [Digital Impact Alliance](https://digitalimpactalliance.org/) (DIAL), [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) (DPGA) + [UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/) and [Ovio](https://ovio.org/) to synchronize and share our data. It served its purpose during the many months that we have been maintaining it, and it has allowed all organizations involved to grow our respective datasets and to coordinate efforts in the joint space in which we operate. We now have realized that there are more efficient ways to accomplish the same goals, and we will continue to periodically share and synchronize our data, while each organization maintains and makes their data publicly available through the resources below:
* **Digital Impact Alliance**
	* [Catalog of Digital Solutions](https://solutions.dial.community/products)
	* [Application Public Interface](https://solutions.dial.community/api/v1/products) (API) and [API Documentation](https://solutions.dial.community/api-docs/index.html)
